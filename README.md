# macos-installer-builder
Generate macOS installers for your applications and products from one command.

Installs the following:
- Arduino IDE (Arduino IDE not included in repo as it is too large to post on GitHub)
- CH34x 1.5 Driver
- Ardublock

To generate .pkg, you need to run:
bash build-macos-x64.sh Barnabas-Robotics 1.0.5

Be sure to change the version # on subsequent builds
